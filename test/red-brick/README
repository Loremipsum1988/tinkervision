This subdirectory contains files necessary for testing of the inclusion into the
Redbrick-API.
	- python-bindings-generator: subset of the TF-generators repository
	  (https://github.com/Tinkerforge/generators).
	  The file configs/brick_red_config.py is adjusted to support the
	  vision-library. Most of the rest has been removed from the repo,
	  and only the Python bindings were kept.
	- scripts: Files to test the bindings, either on-device or remotely.
	  In general, they should work in both cases IF the host-ip is corrected.
